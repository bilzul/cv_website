# Security and Error Handling Improvements

This document outlines the security and error handling improvements made to the CV website.

## Security Enhancements

### 1. CSRF Protection

- Added CSRF token generation and verification to all admin forms
- Implemented a consistent CSRF verification approach with the `verify_csrf_token()` function
- Added token regeneration on successful verification to prevent token reuse

### 2. Secure Password Management

- Upgraded from insecure MD5 hashing to PHP's secure password hashing
- Added automatic migration of old MD5 passwords to secure hashing when users log in

### 3. Content Security Policy (CSP)

- Implemented Content Security Policy headers to prevent XSS attacks
- Restricted resource loading to trusted sources
- Added nonce generation for inline scripts when needed

### 4. Subresource Integrity (SRI)

- Added integrity checks for external resources
- Implemented functions to calculate SRI hashes for local assets
- Added crossorigin attributes to resources with integrity checks

### 5. Additional Security Headers

- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- Permissions-Policy: restricting sensitive permissions

## Error Handling Improvements

### 1. Unified Error Handling

- Added `handle_app_error()` function for standardized error handling
- Supports different error types (error, warning, info, success)
- Optional error logging to files for persistent error tracking

### 2. Asset Fallbacks

- Created fallback.js and fallback.css for when main assets fail to load
- Implemented automatic detection of asset loading failures
- Graceful degradation when resources can't be loaded

### 3. Image Error Handling

- Fixed broken image handling with proper fallbacks
- Added placeholder images with appropriate styling
- Implemented try-catch blocks for error handling

### 4. Database Error Handling

- Enhanced database error reporting with more user-friendly messages
- Proper error handling for database connection failures
- Improved error logging for database operations

## Mobile Responsiveness Improvements

### 1. Viewport Fixes

- Added dynamic viewport height calculation for mobile browsers
- Fixed mobile interaction issues with larger touch targets
- Added swipe detection for mobile navigation

### 2. Mobile UI Enhancements

- Added responsive utility classes for better mobile display
- Improved form controls for mobile interaction
- Enhanced mobile navigation with improved menu toggle

## Performance and User Experience

### 1. Loading Optimization

- Added asynchronous loading for non-critical resources
- Implemented proper error handling for resource loading
- Added visual feedback during loading operations

### 2. Animation and Feedback

- Added fade-in animations for smoother page transitions
- Enhanced hover effects with proper mobile equivalents
- Implemented a back-to-top button for better navigation

### 3. Browser Compatibility

- Added fallbacks for features not supported in all browsers
- Enhanced CSS with cross-browser compatible properties
- Improved JavaScript compatibility with feature detection

## Testing Tools

The following test tools have been created to verify the security of the website:

### 1. Security Test Suite

- Comprehensive test suite for all security and error handling features
- Provides automatic testing for headers, CSP, output buffering, and more
- Accessible at `/admin/test_security.php`

### 2. CSRF Protection Test

- Scans all admin files for CSRF token implementation
- Verifies both token fields and verification function calls
- Provides guidance for correct implementation

### 3. SRI Implementation Test

- Tests Subresource Integrity implementation for local and external resources
- Generates SRI hashes for verification
- Shows correct implementation examples

### 4. Error Handling Test

- Tests the application error handling system
- Verifies error logging functionality
- Checks for proper session-based error storage

### 5. Font Awesome Icon Test

- Tests the icon fix implementation
- Provides comparison of standard and fixed icons
- Includes fallback icon system test

## Maintenance Recommendations

1. Regularly update all external libraries and dependencies
2. Run periodic security audits using tools like OWASP ZAP
3. Monitor error logs for recurring issues
4. Test on multiple devices and browsers regularly
5. Update SRI hashes whenever assets are modified using `generate_sri.php`
6. Run the test suite periodically to ensure security measures are working
7. Keep documentation updated with any changes to security implementations
